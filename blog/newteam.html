      Let me set the stage. It's Season 1 with a new team. We have had practices and scrimmages, and up until the weekend we hadn't had our first game yet.
    It's been a struggle for sure. The same way I'm getting used to the new players and their personalities, the players are getting used to having a new coach.
    I worked with the previous coach in the 2 prior seasons in the same age group, so I have a little bit of an understanding of her style and how we are similar 
    and different. I understand it was never going to be a perfect match on Day 1; I planned on cutting the team some slack as they adjusted to new and different 
    standards. We are in week 4 now, it's time to get productive.

      Have you ever had players that, for the life of you, you can't seem to figure out? You're not sure how to get through to them? It's difficult to get them
    on the same page as the rest of the team? I'm sure we have all been there, it's not a brand new problem specific to me. Everyone goes through it at some point,
    as a coach or not. It's not even so much about the distracting player, it's about the group. I'm trying to make a team and I've got someone actively prohibiting that.
    Progress is an uphill battle, it's exhausting when it feels like someone is pulling us back down. We keep it pushing though and every practice is another
    chance to keep us heading in the right direction. I am constantly looking for different ways to frame and reframe team concepts to try to break through.

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Huddle Up Media</strong> — where real coaches talk about real coaching. 
    This site is all about giving fans and coaches an inside look at the decisions, 
    strategies, and conversations that shape the game.</p>

    <p>I’ll be breaking down matches, sharing coaching insights, and showing you 
    the “why” behind what happens on the field. My goal is simple: to bring 
    authentic coaching perspectives to the sports conversation.</p>

    <p>Whether you’re a coach, a player, or just a fan who wants to understand the 
    game at a deeper level, you’re in the right place. Let’s get started.</p>
